### **Project Medea: Technical Roadmap for a Scalable, Multi-Tenant AI Chatbot SaaS Platform**

**To:** The Engineering Team
**From:** Gemini, Software Architect
**Date:** July 25, 2024
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Initial Draft

-----

### **1. Introduction: The Vision for Medea**

Project Medea's objective is to evolve our current AI chatbot prototype into a resilient, scalable, and secure multi-tenant SaaS platform. This document outlines the technical roadmap, architectural vision, and engineering efforts required to achieve this. We will leverage the strengths of the Haskell ecosystem to build a product that is not only performant and reliable but also a pleasure to maintain and extend.

### **2. High-Level Architecture: A Composable, Asynchronous System**

Our target architecture is a set of communicating services, containerized and orchestrated for scalability and resilience. The core principles are:

  * **Immutability and Pure Functions:** We will continue to leverage Haskell's strengths in this area to minimize side effects and build a predictable, testable system.
  * **Asynchronous Communication:** Services will communicate asynchronously via a message bus, which will improve responsiveness and decouple components.
  * **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** We will separate the read and write paths of our application to optimize for both. This will be particularly important for handling high volumes of chat messages and providing fast query responses for conversation histories.
  * **Event Sourcing:** We will explore event sourcing as a pattern for our core domain (chat conversations) to provide a complete audit trail and enable powerful features like replaying conversations and analyzing user behavior.

### **3. The Technology Stack: A Curated Selection of Haskell Libraries**

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Framework** | `servant` | Provides a type-safe and declarative way to define our API, which will be crucial for maintaining a consistent and well-documented API as the system grows. We will migrate from Scotty to Servant. |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** | A robust, open-source, and highly scalable relational database with excellent support in the Haskell ecosystem via the `postgresql-simple` and `esqueleto` libraries. |
| **Asynchronous Message Bus** | **RabbitMQ** | A mature and widely-used message broker that will enable asynchronous communication between our services. We'll use a library like `amqp` for integration. |
| **Distributed Cache** | **Redis** | A high-performance in-memory data store that we will use for session management and caching frequently accessed data. The `hedis` library will be our interface. |
| **Deployment** | **Docker & Kubernetes** | The standard for containerization and orchestration, providing a scalable and resilient deployment environment. |
| **Configuration Management** | `configurator-ng` | A flexible and powerful library for managing application configuration across different environments. |
| **Logging** | `katip` | A structured logging framework that will allow us to produce detailed and machine-readable logs for monitoring and debugging. |
| **Testing** | `hspec` & `QuickCheck` | The standard for unit and property-based testing in Haskell. We will also use `hspec-wai` for integration testing our API. |

### **4. The Development Roadmap: A Phased Approach to Building Our SaaS Platform**

This roadmap is divided into four phases, each with a clear set of goals and deliverables.

#### **Phase 1: Foundational Infrastructure (3-6 Months)**

  * **Goal:** Lay the groundwork for a scalable and secure multi-tenant application.
  * **Key Deliverables:**
      * **Migrate to PostgreSQL:**
          * Design a multi-tenant database schema with row-level security to isolate customer data.
          * Write database migration scripts using a library like `postgresql-migration`.
      * **Implement User Authentication and Authorization:**
          * Integrate `servant-auth` to provide secure, token-based authentication.
          * Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
      * **Introduce a Message Bus:**
          * Set up a RabbitMQ instance and integrate it into our application.
          * Refactor the `runPrompt` function in `src/App/LLM.hs` to be asynchronous, publishing a "prompt received" event to the message bus and having a separate worker service to consume these events and interact with the LLM.
      * **Containerize and Deploy:**
          * Create Dockerfiles for each of our services.
          * Write Kubernetes deployment manifests for a staging environment.

#### **Phase 2: Core SaaS Features (6-9 Months)**

  * **Goal:** Implement the core features of our SaaS offering.
  * **Key Deliverables:**
      * **Subscription Management:**
          * Integrate Stripe for handling recurring payments and subscription lifecycle events (e.g., upgrades, downgrades, cancellations).
          * Model subscription plans and feature flags in our database.
      * **Admin Dashboard:**
          * Build a separate web application for administrators to manage users, subscriptions, and view application metrics.
      * **API for Third-Party Integrations:**
          * Design and document a public API using `servant-swagger` to allow customers to integrate our chatbot into their own applications.

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features and Scalability (9-12 Months)**\</h4\>

  * **Goal:** Differentiate our product with advanced features and ensure it can handle a growing user base.
  * **Key Deliverables:**
      * **Customizable Chatbots:**
          * Allow users to define custom system prompts, and few-shot examples for their chatbots.
          * Implement a system for users to upload and manage their own knowledge bases (e.g., PDFs, text files), and use a vector database like **Weaviate** or **Pinecone** for efficient retrieval.
      * **Team Collaboration:**
          * Implement features for users to invite team members, share conversation histories, and collaborate on chatbot development.
      * **Performance Optimization:**
          * Conduct load testing to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
          * Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.

#### **Phase 4: Long-Term Vision and Innovation (12+ Months)**

  * **Goal:** Position our product as a leader in the AI chatbot space.
  * **Key Deliverables:**
      * **Marketplace for Tools and Prompts:**
          * Build a platform for users to share and monetize their own custom tools and prompt libraries.
      * **Fine-tuning and Model Training:**
          * Explore offering fine-tuning services to allow customers to train their own custom LLM models on their own data.
      * **Enterprise-Grade Features:**
          * Implement features like Single Sign-On (SSO), audit logs, and advanced security controls to attract enterprise customers.

### **5. Challenges and Resolutions: Navigating the Path to Production**

| Challenge | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Managing Complexity in a Distributed System** | We will use **structured logging**, **distributed tracing**, and **centralized monitoring** to gain visibility into the behavior of our system. We will also invest in comprehensive integration testing to ensure that our services work together correctly. |
| **Ensuring Data Security and Privacy** | We will conduct regular security audits, implement a robust access control model, and encrypt all sensitive data both in transit and at rest. We will also be mindful of data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. |
| **Hiring and Onboarding Haskell Engineers** | We will invest in creating a high-quality, well-documented codebase and a supportive engineering culture to attract and retain top Haskell talent. We will also contribute to the open-source Haskell community to raise our profile. |
| **Keeping up with the Fast-Paced World of AI** | We will build a flexible and extensible architecture that allows us to easily integrate new LLMs, vector databases, and other AI technologies as they emerge. We will also foster a culture of continuous learning and experimentation within the engineering team. |

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve as we learn more about our customers' needs and the changing technological landscape. I am confident that by working together and leveraging the power of Haskell, we can build a world-class product that we can all be proud of.
